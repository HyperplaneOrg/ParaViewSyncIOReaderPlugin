ParaView/VTK Reader for "SyncIO" PHASTA output files. 

-For more information on PHASTA see https://github.com/PHASTA/phasta
-For more information on ParaView see http://paraview.org/

Building:

To build this plugin you'll need a compiled ParaView build tree or a ParaView install with the development files installed. First locate the directory containing ParaViewConfig.cmake - we'll call it $PARAVIEW_DIR

Make a build directory for this plugin:

mkdir build
cd build

Create a Makefile:

cmake -DParaView_DIR=$PARAVIEW_DIR ../syncio_plugin

Make:

make

If all goes well, you should have a shared library libPhastaSyncIOReader.so (or .dynlib or .dll, depending on your platform)

Running: 

Open up ParaView, from the "Tools" menu choose "Manage Plugins". Click "Load New" and choose the shared library that you built in the last step.

You should now see "PhastaSyncIOReader" in the right pane. You may want to expand it and check the "Auto Load" box. 

You should now be able to load a ".phts" file (these are the same as regular PHASTA pht files, the extension has been changed to differentiate them from old style "POSIX" IO files).
